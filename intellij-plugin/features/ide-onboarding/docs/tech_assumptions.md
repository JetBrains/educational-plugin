# IDE Onboarding Feature - Technical Assumptions and Decisions

## Core Technical Decisions

### 1. Service Architecture
- **Decision**: Use project-level service for onboarding management
- **Rationale**:
  * Single responsibility for onboarding flow
  * Project scope isolation
  * Proper resource lifecycle management
  * Integration with IDE's service system

### 2. Coroutine Usage
- **Decision**: Implement asynchronous operations using Kotlin coroutines
- **Rationale**:
  * Clean asynchronous code
  * Proper UI thread handling
  * Structured concurrency
  * Cancellation support

### 3. Step-Based Architecture
- **Decision**: Implement onboarding as discrete steps
- **Rationale**:
  * Modular implementation
  * Easy to extend
  * Clear state management
  * Simplified testing

### 4. UI Component Management
- **Decision**: Use layered UI components with animation support
- **Rationale**:
  * Clean separation of UI elements
  * Flexible animation system
  * Proper z-order management
  * Resource cleanup

## Technical Assumptions

### 1. Platform Assumptions
- IntelliJ Platform 2023.1 or later
- Kotlin 1.8 or later
- Java 17 or later runtime
- Swing UI framework availability

### 2. Resource Assumptions
- Sufficient memory for animations
- Available EDT for UI operations
- Tool windows accessibility
- Action system availability

### 3. State Management Assumptions
- Single onboarding tour at a time
- Atomic state transitions
- Proper disposal on project close
- Persistence of animation data

### 4. UI Assumptions
- Swing EDT availability
- Layer management support
- Window focus control
- Component visibility management

## Implementation Constraints

### 1. Thread Management

- State updates must be thread-safe
- Animation frames on UI thread

### 2. Resource Management
- Proper component disposal
- Memory leak prevention
- Animation resource cleanup
- Service lifecycle handling

### 3. State Consistency
- Atomic state updates
- Proper cancellation handling
- Clean state transitions
- Error state recovery

### 4. UI Constraints
- Layer compatibility
- Animation performance
- Component lifecycle
- Focus management
