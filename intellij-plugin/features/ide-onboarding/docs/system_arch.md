# IDE Onboarding Feature - System Architecture

## Architectural Overview

### Core Architecture Patterns

1. Service-Based Architecture
   - Project-level service (EduUiOnboardingService)
   - Singleton pattern for service access
   - Disposable resource management
   - Clear service lifecycle

2. Step-Based Execution Pattern
   - Sequential step execution
   - Step state management
   - Step transition system
   - Dynamic step availability

3. Event-Driven Architecture
   - Coroutine-based event handling
   - EDT (Event Dispatch Thread) integration
   - Event-based state transitions
   - Asynchronous execution flow

4. Component-Based UI Architecture
   - Layered UI components
   - Animation system integration
   - UI state management
   - Component lifecycle handling

### System Components

1. Core Services
   ```
   EduUiOnboardingService
   ├── State Management
   ├── Step Coordination
   └── Lifecycle Control
   ```

2. Execution Engine
   ```
   EduUiOnboardingExecutor
   ├── Step Execution
   ├── Transition Management
   ├── Animation Control
   └── Resource Management
   ```

3. Step System
   ```
   EduUiOnboardingStep
   ├── Welcome Step
   ├── Task Description Step
   ├── Code Editor Step
   ├── Check Solution Step
   └── Course View Step
   ```

4. Animation System
   ```
   Animation Components
   ├── Transition Animations
   ├── UI Components
   ├── State Animations
   └── Resource Management
   ```

### Architectural Principles

1. Separation of Concerns
   - Clear separation between UI and logic
   - Isolated step implementations
   - Dedicated animation system
   - Independent state management

2. Resource Management
   - Proper disposal of resources
   - Memory leak prevention
   - Component lifecycle tracking
   - Clean state transitions

3. Extensibility
   - Pluggable step system
   - Customizable animations
   - Flexible state management
   - Modular component design

4. Reliability
   - State consistency
   - Error handling
   - Resource cleanup
   - Thread safety
