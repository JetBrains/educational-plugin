# IDE Onboarding Feature - Test Scenarios

## Implemented Test Cases

### Project Activity Tests
1. Tour Activation for New Project
   - Test Name: "Test tour is shown for new project"
   - Precondition: Clean project state
   - Action: Execute project activity
   - Verification: Tour marked as shown

2. Tour Skip via System Property
   - Test Name: "Test tour is skipped when system property is set"
   - Precondition: System property set to skip
   - Action: Execute project activity
   - Verification: Tour marked as shown without display

3. Non-Educational Project Handling
   - Test Name: "Test tour is not shown for non-edu project"
   - Precondition: Non-educational project
   - Action: Execute project activity
   - Verification: Tour not marked as shown
