# Technical Assumptions and Decisions

## Core Assumptions

### 1. Python Environment
- Python SDK is available on the target system
- Python virtual environments are supported
- Python version compatibility is managed through SDK detection
- Standard Python package management tools are available

### 2. IDE Integration
- IntelliJ Platform API provides necessary extension points
- Python Plugin is available and compatible
- IDE-specific features are isolated in separate modules
- Platform-specific implementations can be loaded dynamically

### 3. Educational Features
- Course structure follows educational-core conventions
- Task checking can be performed in isolated environments
- Template-based course creation is sufficient
- Test files follow standard Python testing patterns

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Architecture Decisions
- Provider Pattern for Task Checking
  - Reason: Allows flexible implementation of different checking strategies
  - Impact: Easy to extend with new checking methods
  - Trade-offs: Additional abstraction layer

- Builder Pattern for Course Creation
  - Reason: Complex object construction with many configurations
  - Impact: Structured and maintainable course creation
  - Trade-offs: More complex than direct construction

- Configurator Pattern for Module Setup
  - Reason: Centralized configuration management
  - Impact: Consistent module behavior
  - Trade-offs: Additional configuration overhead

### 2. Implementation Decisions
- Kotlin as Primary Language
  - Reason: Modern language features and IntelliJ Platform compatibility
  - Impact: Better integration with platform
  - Trade-offs: Team needs Kotlin expertise

- Separate IDE-specific Modules
  - Reason: Clean separation of IDE-specific code
  - Impact: Better maintainability
  - Trade-offs: More complex project structure

- Test-First Development
  - Reason: Ensure reliability and maintainability
  - Impact: Higher code quality
  - Trade-offs: Development time

### 3. Integration Decisions
- Python Plugin Dependencies
  - Reason: Leverage existing Python support
  - Impact: Full Python language support
  - Trade-offs: Version compatibility management

- Educational Core Integration
  - Reason: Consistent educational features
  - Impact: Standard course structure
  - Trade-offs: Dependency on core module

- TOML Support
  - Reason: Configuration file management
  - Impact: Structured configuration
  - Trade-offs: Additional plugin dependency

## Future Considerations

### 1. Compatibility
- Future Python versions support
- IDE platform version updates
- Educational core API changes

### 2. Extensibility
- New task types support
- Additional checking strategies
- Custom template systems

### 3. Maintenance
- Test coverage requirements
- Documentation updates
- Dependency management

## Known Limitations

### 1. Technical Limitations
- Python SDK availability required
- IDE version compatibility
- Platform-specific features

### 2. Feature Limitations
- Fixed task template structure
- Standard test patterns required
- Limited customization options

### 3. Integration Limitations
- Plugin dependencies required
- Platform API constraints
- Educational core compatibility
