Let's start describing solutions to the problem using natural language.

First, find out from the user the age of his dog in human years.
Save the age into a variable named `humanYears` so that it can be manipulated further.

<div class="hint" title="Example of a description">

```kotlin
fun calculateDogAgeInDogYears() {
  description("""
        Get the user input and save the result to a variable named humanYears.
    """.trimIndent())
}
```
</div>
