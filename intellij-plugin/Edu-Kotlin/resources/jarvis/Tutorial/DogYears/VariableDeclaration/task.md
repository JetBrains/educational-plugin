All variable or function names, or calls to them or any code, need to be wrapped in \`\`, so that it can be clearly used later.
Therefore, wrap the humanYears variable in \`\` and then write it in \`\` when you use it.

<div class="hint" title="Example of a description">

```kotlin
fun calculateDogAgeInDogYears() {
    description("""
        Get the user input and save the result to a variable named `humanYears`.
    """.trimIndent())
}
```
</div>
