### Project description

The project of this lesson is **Age in Dog Years**.
A dog's age is often calculated in "dog years", where 1 "dog year" is equivalent to 7 human years. Let's reverse that.
The goal of this game is to ask the user to provide their dog's age in human years, and convert it to dog years.

### Project examples
