### Warming up
Now you are ready to use the power of **Cognifire**! 
Write a **prompt** block as shown below inside the `calculateDogAgeInDogYears` function.
Further, you will write the logic and necessary steps of your program between the triple quotes (`"""`).

```kotlin
prompt("""

""")
```

You will need to import Cognifire. To do that, add the following lines to the top of this file:
```kt
import org.jetbrains.academy.cognifire.dsl.prompt
import org.jetbrains.academy.cognifire.dsl.code
```
