### Let's write some ~~_code_~~ words!

First, find the age of the user's dog in human years.
\
Save the age into a variable named `humanYears` for future use.

<div class="hint" title="Example of a prompt">

```kotlin
fun calculateDogAgeInDogYears() {
  prompt("""
        Get the user input and save the result to a variable named humanYears.
    """)
}
```
</div>
