Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in software development. 
They help us to group blocks of code that perform a specific task. 
Functions provide a way to break our code into manageable, reusable, and testable parts.

### Task

Let's implement the task by creating a main function `calculateDogAgeInDogYears` and a function to check the input of `verifyHumanYearsInput` using the fun keyword.
In the function `verifyHumanYearsInput` pass the parameter `humanYears` with type `Int` and the function will return the value of the `Boolean` type (true or false depending on whether the verification was successful).

<div class="hint" title="The basic syntax for declaring a function">

```kotlin
fun functionName(parameter1: Type, parameter2: Type): ReturnType {
    TODO("Not implemented yet")
}
```
* `fun` - the keyword used to declare a function.
* `functionName` - the name of the function.
* `parameter1`: Type, `parameter2`: Type - the parameters of the function (if any) and their types. You can have any number of parameters and their types listed, separated by commas
* `ReturnType` - the type of the value returned by the function. If the function doesnâ€™t return anything, its type would be `Unit`, which is usually omitted.
