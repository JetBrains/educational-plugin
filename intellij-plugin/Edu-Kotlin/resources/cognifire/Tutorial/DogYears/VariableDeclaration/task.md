### Identifier names
All variable or function names, or calls to them or any code, need to be wrapped in `` ` `` (backticks), so that it can be clearly used later.
Therefore, wrap the `humanYears` variable in `` ` `` and then write it in `` ` `` when you use it.

<div class="hint" title="Example of a prompt">

```kotlin
fun calculateDogAgeInDogYears() {
    prompt("""
        Get the user input and save the result to a variable named `humanYears`.
    """)
}
```
</div>
