    1. amount: The number of steps for the task. (Answer with the number of steps)

    2. specifics: Are the steps related to the specific actions? (A specific action in the context of a task resolution step can be defined as a clearly delineated instruction to perform a particular command, operation, or method in the code. If all steps relate to specific actions, such as creating a variable, calling a function or using a coding construction such as a loop or if statement, answer with "Yes". If there are broader and more abstract step(s) like "understand the requirements" or "analyze the provided examples" or "test the function" that don't specify a concrete action to be performed in the code, answer with "No" and specify which step(s) are not specific)

    3. independence: Are the steps independent? (If each step does not refer to previous steps, answer with "Yes". If there are step(s) that refer to other steps e.g. "repeat steps 3-5" or "... in step 2", answer with "No" and specify which step(s) are not independent)

    4. codingSpecific: Are the steps about coding tasks? (If each step is related to coding tasks such as adding a variable, changing the initial value etc, then answer with "Coding". If there are non-coding step(s) related to understanding the project, requirements gathering, or other tasks that don't involve direct interaction with the code like "read and understand the task" or "run the program", answer with "Not coding" and specify which step(s) have type "Not coding")

    5. direction: Do the steps solve the problem algorithmically? (If following all the steps results in a correct algorithm that accurately solves the task as per the task description, answer with "Yes"; if no, answer with "No" and specify why not and how it can be improved. You can compare the author's solution and the step solution, but it could be different and still be correct.)

    6. misleadingInformation: Does the steps contain misleading information? (If there are no such steps, answer "No". If there are step(s) that, for example, involves the use of non-existent functions, or the use of incorrect constants compared to the author's solution, or contains unnecessary additional steps that could be confusing, answer "Yes" and specify which step(s) and which misleading information)

    7. granularity: Is every step limited to one step? (If each step is an explanation of one distinct concrete action or operation, answer with "Yes". If there are step(s) that involve multiple actions, such as declaring multiple variables or operations, or declaring a variable and calling a function, which means they can be divided into several separate steps, answer with "No" and specify which step(s) and how they can be divided)

    8. kotlinStyle: Are the steps idiomatically correct in Kotlin language? (This means step explanations make use of built-in Kotlin functions and approaches appropriate to the language. Compare with the author's solution to see what Kotlin style functions are used. If all steps conform to Kotlin idiomatic style, answer with "Yes". If there are step(s) that are not, answer with "No" and specify which step(s) are not)

(If the hint is directly working towards the solution of the problem in the task description, and follows the solution steps, given the current state of the student's code and does not ignore errors, answer with "Yes". If the hint is inconsistent with the task's goal, misleads the student, suggests incorrect actions or ignores any errors, answer with "No" and provide an explanation for your decision.

    7. misleadingInformation: Does the hint contain misleading information? (Misleading information includes, but is not limited to, proposing a solution that leads in a different direction, suggesting the implementation of an irrelevant function, or providing information that doesn't align with the task's requirements, or deviating from the solution steps or ignoring errors. If the hint does not contain any misleading information and assists in solving the task correctly, answer with "No".
