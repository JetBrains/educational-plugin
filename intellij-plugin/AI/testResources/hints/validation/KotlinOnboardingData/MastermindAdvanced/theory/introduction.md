Congratulations! The basic version of the **Bulls and cows (Mastermind)** game is ready!
However, it's not interesting to play if the hidden word is always the same, is it?

### Project description

You have already implemented a basic version of the **Bulls and cows (Mastermind)** game.
In this project, we will introduce two more concepts and improve the game by generating
a random secret and adding checks for user inputs.

We put the default implementation of the game into the `Main.kt` file from the last step of the previous task.
Feel free to replace it with your own implementation.

### Lesson topics

- `random` function;
- generating random strings;
- built-in functions for working with the List collection.

### Project example

![The game's example](../../utils/src/main/resources/images/part1/warmup/game.gif "The game's example")

To make the picture fit, additional line breaks were added.
You don't need to add them when solving the task.
