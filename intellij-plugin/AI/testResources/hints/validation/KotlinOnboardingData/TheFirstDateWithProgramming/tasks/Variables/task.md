In this task, we will add variables to store the user's answers.

### Task

Add empty `String` variables to hold the user's answers, named
_firstUserAnswer_, _secondUserAnswer_, and _thirdUserAnswer_.

If you have any difficulties, **hints will help you solve this task**.

### Hints

<div class="hint" title="Click me to learn which keyword — val or var — is better to use">

In the current task, it is better to use the `val` keyword, since we will just _save_ values from the user
into the variables and will not change them afterwards.
