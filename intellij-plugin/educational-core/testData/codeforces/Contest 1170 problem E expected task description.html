  <p>Imagine that you are the CEO of a big old-fashioned company. Unlike any modern and progressive company (such as JetBrains), your company has a dress code. That's why you have already allocated a spacious room for your employees where they can change their clothes. Moreover, you've already purchased an $m$-compartment wardrobe, so the $i$-th employee can keep his/her belongings in the $i$-th cell (of course, all compartments have equal widths).</p>
  <p>The issue has occurred: the wardrobe has sliding doors! More specifically, the wardrobe has $n$ doors (numbered from left to right) and the $j$-th door has width equal to $a_j$ wardrobe's cells. The wardrobe has single rails so that no two doors can slide past each other.</p>

   <img class="tex-graphics" src="https://espresso.codeforces.com/d386d5dda686a64db2d590ef631aaf51b72c215c.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> <span class="tex-font-size-small">Extremely schematic example of a wardrobe: $m=9$, $n=2$, $a_1=2$, $a_2=3$.</span>
  </center>
  <p>The problem is as follows: sometimes to open some cells you must close some other cells (since all doors are placed on the single track). For example, if you have a $4$-compartment wardrobe (i.e. $m=4$) with $n=2$ one-cell doors (i.e. $a_1=a_2=1$) and you need to open the $1$-st and the $3$-rd cells, you have to close the $2$-nd and the $4$-th cells.</p>
  <p>As CEO, you have a complete schedule for the next $q$ days. Now you are wondering: is it possible that all employees who will come on the $k$-th day can access their cells simultaneously?</p>

   Input
  </div>
  <p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le m \le 4 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of doors and compartments respectively.</p>
  <p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le m$, $\sum{a_i} \le m$) — the corresponding widths of the doors.</p>
  <p>The third line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of days you have to process.</p>
  <p>The next $q$ lines describe schedule of each day. Each schedule is represented as an integer $c_k$ followed by $c_k$ integers $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_{c_k}$ ($1 \le c_k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le w_1 &lt; w_2 &lt; \dots &lt; w_{c_k} \le m$) — the number of employees who will come on the $k$-th day, and their indices in ascending order.</p>
  <p>It's guaranteed that $\sum{c_k}$ doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

  <p>Print $q$ answers. Each answer is "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" or "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>" (case insensitive). Print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" if it is possible, that all employees on the corresponding day can access their compartments simultaneously.</p>
