# Python Interpreter Version Suggestion Implementation

## Current Problem

Currently, when a user tries to open a course that requires a specific Python version, and their interpreter is incompatible (e.g., Python 2
instead of Python 3, or an older version than required), the system shows an error message that directs them to configuration instructions.
This creates friction in the user experience as users need to:

1. Read the error message
2. Follow the configuration link
3. Manually figure out which Python version to download
4. Set up the interpreter themselves

## How It Works in Regular Python Projects

In regular Python projects, when creating a virtual environment with an incompatible or missing interpreter:

1. The IDE detects the missing/incompatible interpreter
2. It shows a suggestion to download the appropriate Python version
3. Users can download and configure the interpreter directly from the IDE
4. The process is streamlined and requires minimal user intervention

The implementation uses `getSdksToInstall()` from the IntelliJ Python plugin to handle interpreter suggestions and downloads.

## Implementation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Enhanced Error Component with Direct Download

This approach enhances the existing error component to include a direct download option:

1. **Detection Phase**:
    - Use existing `validate()` and `isSdkApplicable()` methods to detect version mismatches
    - Keep the current error types (`NoApplicablePythonError` and `SpecificPythonRequiredError`)

2. **UI Enhancement**:
    - Extend `ValidationMessage` to support an action button
    - Add a "Download Python X.Y" button next to the error message
    - Use the existing "download_python_${version}" link infrastructure

3. **Download Integration**:
    - Integrate with `getSdksToInstall()` from the Python plugin
    - Use Python plugin's download and setup mechanisms
    - Automatically configure the downloaded interpreter

**Advantages**:

- Minimal changes to existing architecture
- Reuses proven Python plugin functionality
- Consistent with regular project experience

**Challenges**:

- Need to handle download failures gracefully
- May require UI adjustments for the new button

### Scenario 2: Proactive Version Check and Suggestion

This approach suggests the correct interpreter version before showing an error:

1. **Early Detection**:
    - Check required Python version during course opening
    - Scan available interpreters before showing any errors
    - Use `PyBaseSdksProvider.getBaseSdks()` for available SDK detection

2. **Suggestion Dialog**:
    - Show a modal dialog before the error component
    - Present options:
        1. Download recommended version
        2. Use another installed version (if compatible)
        3. Configure manually (current behavior)

3. **Integration**:
    - Use `PySdkToCreateVirtualEnv` for virtual environment setup
    - Integrate with Python plugin's download functionality
    - Provide progress indication during download

**Advantages**:

- Better user experience with proactive suggestions
- More flexible options for users
- Prevents errors before they occur

**Challenges**:

- More complex implementation
- Additional UI components needed
- Need to handle multiple suggestion scenarios

## Technical Considerations

Both scenarios would require:

1. Integration with Python plugin's download mechanisms
2. Proper error handling for network issues
3. Progress indication during downloads
4. Proper SDK configuration after download
5. Testing for various Python versions and platforms

## Recommendation

Scenario 1 is recommended for initial implementation because:

1. It requires fewer changes to existing code
2. Maintains consistency with current error handling
3. Can be extended to Scenario 2 in future iterations
4. Provides immediate value with minimal risk

The implementation can be done incrementally:

1. First step: Complete the download functionality in PyLanguageSettings
   - Implement downloadPythonSdk function to handle SDK download using Python plugin's getSdksToInstall()
   - Implement configurePythonSdk function to set up the downloaded SDK
   - Enhance error handling with proper user feedback
   - Add progress indication during download and configuration
   - Test the download functionality with different Python versions

2. Then integrate download functionality
3. Finally, add automatic configuration of downloaded interpreters
