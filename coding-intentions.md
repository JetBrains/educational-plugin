# Coding Intentions

This document outlines the key principles that should be followed when contributing to this project.

## Core Principles

1. **Use AI-docs to write and understand code**
   - Leverage AI documentation to better understand existing code
   - Create comprehensive AI-docs for new code to help others understand your implementation
   - Keep AI documentation up-to-date when modifying code

2. **Do not produce code with duplicates**
   - Always check for existing implementations before writing new code
   - Extract common functionality into reusable components
   - Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle consistently
   - Refactor duplicated code when discovered

3. **Always add tests**
   - Write unit tests for all new functionality
   - Ensure tests cover both normal cases and edge cases
   - Maintain and update tests when modifying existing code
   - Aim for high test coverage to ensure code reliability

4. **Before writing code, produce artifacts with implementation plans and behavioral scenarios**
   - Create detailed implementation plans outlining the approach
   - Document expected behavior through scenarios
   - Consider edge cases and error handling in your planning
   - Use these artifacts to guide development and as reference for reviewers
