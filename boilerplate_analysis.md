# Boilerplate Code Analysis in PyEduUtils

## 1. Task Extensions
- `getCurrentTaskVirtualFile` and `getCurrentTaskFilePath`: Standard task file handling operations
- Common pattern of null checking and file system traversal
- Typical educational plugin file handling boilerplate

## 2. Attribute Configuration
- `pythonAttributesEvaluator`: Standard configuration boilerplate
- Common pattern for excluding files and directories
- Typical archive policy configuration

## 3. Package Management
- `installRequiredPackages`: Standard package installation boilerplate
- Common patterns:
  - Coroutine scope handling
  - Background progress tracking
  - Package manager interaction
  - File-level warning cleanup

## 4. Version Management
- `getSupportedVersions`: Standard version listing boilerplate
- Common pattern for version management in Python context

## 5. File System Operations
- Extension property `systemDependentPath`: Common file path conversion boilerplate
- Standard constants for excluded folders

## Common Boilerplate Patterns
1. Null safety checks and error handling
2. File system path manipulations
3. Progress tracking in long-running operations
4. Coroutine context switching
5. Resource cleanup operations

This boilerplate code follows standard patterns for:
- Educational plugin task management
- Python environment configuration
