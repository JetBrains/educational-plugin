You are already familiar with the concept of variable from the previous lesson.
However, you've been only working with `String` variables so far.
Meanwhile, in programming, it is common to use variables of _different_ types.

For example, the `String` type stores strings, like `"ABCD"`,
and the `Int` type stores integer numbers, like `55`.
In addition, you should pay attention to
the special type [`Boolean`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-types.html#booleans),
which can only have two values - `true` (yes) or `false` (no).

Variable types differ in their functionality. For example,
if we add two numbers `2` and `3`, we get a new number `5`.
However, if we represent them as strings, we get `"2" + "3" = "23"`.
You can find a complete list of base types in the [official documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-types.html).
