Hurrah! In this task we will finish the base game.

### Task

Modify the `playGame` function: add a variable that counts the number of the user's attempts.
We need to count the attempts from zero, which means the user can try to guess the secret `maxAttemptsCount` + 1 times.
The `playGame` function should print the following messages to inform the user: `Sorry, you lost! :( My word is <secret>` and `Congratulations! You guessed it!`.
Use `isWon` and `isLost` from the previous steps inside the loop to check the current game state.

Before each question to the user please use `Please input your guess. It should be of length <wordLength>.` text.

**Note**: to avoid typos just copy the text from here and paste into your code.
