In this task we will implement the `isComplete` function, since the current implementation always returns `true`.

### Task

Implement the `isComplete` function. It should return `true` 
if `secret` and `guess` are the same and `false` otherwise.

If you have any difficulties, **hints will help you solve this task**.

### Hints

<div class="hint" title="Click me to get a code style hint">

If you compare two variables to get a `Boolean` result, you can use the short notation. 
For example, the following code:
```
fun isNotEqual(a: Int, b: Int) = if (a != b) {
    true
} else {
    false
}
```
can be replaced with this one:
```
fun isNotEqual(a: Int, b: Int) = a != b
```
</div>
