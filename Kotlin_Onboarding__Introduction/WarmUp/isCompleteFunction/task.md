In this task we will create a function to check if the game is complete.

### Task

- Define a function `isComplete`, which accepts `secret` and `guess` and checks if the game is over.
  For now, let it always return `true`. We will implement the function logic later.

<div class="hint" title="Click me to see the signature of the isComplete function">

The signature of the function is:
```kotlin
fun isComplete(secret: String, guess: String): Boolean
```
</div>
