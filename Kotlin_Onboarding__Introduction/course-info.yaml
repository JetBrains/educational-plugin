title: "Kotlin Onboarding: Introduction"
language: English
summary: "<p>This course is designed for novices in Kotlin and focuses on the basic\
  \ concepts of the Kotlin language. Each lesson of the course is built in the form\
  \ of a project: step by step, by completing different small tasks, you will get\
  \ a finished small project in the end. At the end of each lesson, an additional\
  \ similar project will be offered: it includes all the lesson topics but does not\
  \ contain the theory part.</p>\n<p><i>Note, this course does not provide a detailed\
  \ explanation of the basic concepts, like variables: it just shows how to use them\
  \ in Kotlin and can briefly remind you the definitions.</i></p>\n<p>All topics will\
  \ be accompanied by links to the official Kotlin documentation, which you can read\
  \ later. After this course, you will be ready to write basic console applications\
  \ in the Kotlin-like style.</p> "
