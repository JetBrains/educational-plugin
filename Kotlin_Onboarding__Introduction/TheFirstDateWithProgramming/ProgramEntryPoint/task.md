It's time to write your first program in Kotlin!

### Task

Change the output text into `Hello!` and run the program.

<div class="hint" title="Click me to learn how to run your program">

To run your program, you need to open the `Main.kt` file and click on the **green triangle** near the `main` function.
Then, the output of the program will be shown in the console:

![Program entry point and console](../../utils/src/main/resources/images/part1/first.date/run_example.gif "Program entry point and console")

</div>
