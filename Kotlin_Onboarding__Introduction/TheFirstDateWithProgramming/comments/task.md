Congratulations, you've almost finished your first project!

Let me share a little trick on how you can write [comments](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-syntax.html#comments)
for other developers (or for yourself) in your code.
To do this, use a double slash at the beginning of the code line:
```kotlin
fun main() {
    // My comment, I can write whatever I want here
}
```
Comments are usually left for the most complex parts of code,
making it easier to understand their functions later on.
