# What this repository is

This repository contains sources of the introduction to Kotlin course.


# Contributing

We love contributions!
We are happy to see fixes of the existing bugs and tasks and tests mistakes.
The current tasks can be found in the [open issues](https://github.com/jetbrains-academy/csc-kotlin-course/issues) in the project.
If you have some questions or find bugs or mistakes, please do not hesitate to open new ones.

Please, add a comment to the issue, if you're starting work on it.

If you add some common functionality, e.g. for the test system, it is important to add comments to describe new behaviour.
This will help other developers and users to use them correctly.

## Submitting patches

The best way to submit a patch is to [fork the project on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
and then send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
to the `main` branch via [GitHub](https://github.com).

If you create your own fork, it might help to enable rebase by default
when you pull by executing
``` bash
git config --global pull.rebase true
```
This will avoid your local repo having too many merge commits
which will help keep your pull request simple and easy to apply.
