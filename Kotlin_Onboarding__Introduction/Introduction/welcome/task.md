Hello! Welcome to the Kotlin course.
This course is designed for novices in Kotlin
and focuses on the basic concepts of the Kotlin language.

Each lesson of the course is built in the form of a project:
step by step, by completing different small tasks,
you will get a finished small project in the end.
At the end of each lesson, an additional similar project will be offered:
it includes all the topics of the lesson but is not divided into small tasks.

All topics will be accompanied by links to [the official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html),
which you can read later.

Note, this course **does not provide detailed explanations** of basic concepts
like variables. Instead, it shows how to use these concepts in Kotlin and may remind you of their definitions.

Please join the course chat on Discord using [this link](https://discord.gg/pN3kfttB). 
There, you can ask questions, interact with instructors, and connect with your fellow students.

Let's get started!
