It's time to practice!

### Task

Implement the `trimPicture` function, which accepts a picture and removes all indents from it. 

<div class="hint" title="Click me to see the new signature of the trimPicture function">

The signature of the function is:
```kotlin
fun trimPicture(picture: String): String
```
</div>

Here's an example of the `trimPicture` function's work:

<img src="../../utils/src/main/resources/images/part1/almost.done/trimmed_picture.gif" height="400" alt="`trimPicture` function work"/>
