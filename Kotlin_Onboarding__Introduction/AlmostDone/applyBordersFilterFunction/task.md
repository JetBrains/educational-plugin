In this task, we will define the _signatures_ for several functions and implement one of them.

### Task

Add several functions to the game:

- _applyBordersFilter_, which takes one string argument, `picture`,
  and returns a new picture with the filter applied.
  For now, you don't need to fully implement this function. Instead, it is enough to use the `TODO`
  function as a placeholder for future implementation.
  We will implement this function when solving later tasks.

<div class="hint" title="Click me to see the signature of the applyBordersFilter function">

The signature of the function is:
```kotlin
fun applyBordersFilter(picture: String): String
```
</div>

<div class="hint" title="Click me to see an example of the borders filter after completing the project">

An example of this filter:
<p>
    <img src="../../utils/src/main/resources/images/part1/almost.done/when_hint_1.png" alt="Filter example" width="200"/>
</p>

</div>

- _applySquaredFilter_, which takes one string argument, `picture`,
  and returns a new picture with the filter applied.
  For now, you don't need to fully implement this function. Instead, it is enough to use the `TODO`
  function as a placeholder for future implementation.
  We will implement this function when solving later tasks.

<div class="hint" title="Click me to see the signature of the applySquaredFilter function">

The signature of the function is:
```kotlin
fun applySquaredFilter(picture: String): String
```
</div>

<div class="hint" title="Click me to see an example of the squared filter after completing the project">

An example of this filter:
<p>
    <img src="../../utils/src/main/resources/images/part1/almost.done/when_hint_2.png" alt="Filter example" width="400"/>
</p>

</div>
