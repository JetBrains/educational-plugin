Hooray! The project is almost finished, there is very little left to do! 
This time, without a new theoretical part!

### Task

Complete the game â€“ implement the `photoshop` function, which combines all functions together. 

<div class="hint" title="Click me to see the signature of the photoshop function">

The signature of the function is:
```kotlin
fun photoshop(): Unit
```
</div>

Firstly, read the picture and the filter using the already implemented functions. 
Next, print the initial picture to the console with the description `The old image:`, 
then apply the filter and print the new picture with the description `The transformed picture:`.
Finally, call this function in the `main` function.

**Note**: to avoid typos, just copy the text from here and paste it into your code.

Also, the `main` function will be checked - just uncomment the code in the `main` function.

<div class="hint" title="Click me to see the console photoshop project example">

![Console photoshop example](../../utils/src/main/resources/images/part1/almost.done/game.gif "Console photoshop example")

</div>
