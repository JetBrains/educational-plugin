This lesson focuses on the topics that you covered in the previous lesson.
The main difference is that this lesson does not contain a theory part â€“ you just need to
implement the project from scratch by yourself. We have no doubt that you will succeed!

The project of this lesson is **Chat**.
The purpose of this game is to ask questions to the user to get to know them better.

Write a console application
that will communicate with the user in an interactive dialogue format:

```text
- Hello! I'm glad to meet you, let me get to know you better! What is your name?
- <some user's answer>
- Nice to meet you, <some user's answer>! My name is Kotlin Bot! I am a young programming language created in 2010. How old are you?
- <some user's answer>
- <some user's age> is great! I hope you successfully complete this course! Anyone can learn programming at any age!
```

An example of the final application:

![Chat example](../../utils/src/main/resources/images/part1/chat/game.gif "Chat example")
